%%% Questions

\noin {\bf Preamble}: An application of linear algebra to calculus. \\

\noin Recall the technique of partial fractions decomposition to evaluate the integral of rational functions.  For example, suppose we would like to evaluate the integral
$$\int \frac{7x^2+7}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \, dx$$

\noin We look for scalars $a, b$, and $c$ such that
$$\frac{7x^2+7}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}  = \frac{ax+b}{x^2+3}+\frac{c}{x-2}$$

\noin After some algebra, we find that $a=2$, $b=4$, and $c=5$, and therefore,
$$\frac{7x^2+7}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}  = \frac{2x+4}{x^2+3}+\frac{5}{x-2}$$

\noin Then, 
\begin{align*}
\int \frac{7x^2+7}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \, dx &= \int \frac{2x+4}{x^2+3}\, dx + \int \frac{5}{x-2}\, dx \\
&=\ln (x^2+3)+\frac{4}{\sqrt 3} \arctan \left (  \frac{x}{\sqrt 3}\right ) +5\ln(x-2) +C
\end{align*}

\noin where $C$ is a constant.

\vspace{20pt}

\noin In Question 1, we will use the theory of basis and dimension in linear algebra to explain why the partial fractions decomposition 
$$\frac{7x^2+7}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}  = \frac{ax+b}{x^2+3}+\frac{c}{x-2}$$

\noin exists, thereby allowing us to solve the integral.


\vspace{90pt}

\noin{\bf 1.}  Let $$V = \left \{ \frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \mid d, e, f\in \mathbb R\right \}$$  

\noin We define vector addition and scalar multiplication in $V$ by the usual function addition and scalar multiplication.  Then $V$ is vector space.

\vspace{20pt}

\noin{(a)}  Prove that $\dim\, V =3$.  Then, explain why a partial fractions decomposition of the form
$$\frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}  = \frac{ax+b}{x^2+3}+\frac{c}{x-2}$$
is consistent with the dimension of $V$. \\

%Question 1(a)

{
	\vspace*{-10pt}
	%%% Do not change the height of this box. Your work must fit inside it.
	
	\makenonemptybox{550pt}{

	%%% Your work goes here! 
		\begin{align}
			V &= \{\frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \mid d, e, f 
			\in \mathbb{R}\} \\
			&= \{d\frac{x^2}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} + e\frac{x}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} + 
			f\frac{1}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \mid d, e, f \in \mathbb{R}\}
		\end{align}
		Since $\frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} = d\frac{x^2}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} +
		e\frac{x}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} + f\frac{1}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}$, 
		therefore elements of $V$ can be written as linear combinations of 
		$\frac{x^2}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}$, $\frac{x}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}$, and 
		$\frac{1}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}$ 
		\begin{align}
			\therefore V = \text{span}\{\frac{x^2}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}, 
			\frac{x}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}, \frac{1}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}\} 
		\end{align}

		$$\text{Let } \frac{x^2}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} = u, \frac{x}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} = v, 
		\frac{1}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} = w$$
		$$\because v = cw \Rightarrow c = x \notin \mathbb{R}$$
		$$\therefore v, w \text{ are linearly independent}$$
		$$\because cv + dw = u \Rightarrow c = x \notin \mathbb{R}, 
		d = 0 \text{ or } c = 0, d = x^2 \notin \mathbb{R}$$
		$$\therefore u, v, w \text{ are linearly independent}$$
		Since $u, v, w$ are linearly independent and $V = \text{span}\{u, v, w\}$, 
		they form a basis for $V$. Therefore $\text{dim } V = 3$ because 3 vectors forms
		the basis of $V$.

		\begin{align}
			\frac{ax+b}{x^2+3}+\frac{c}{x-2} &= \frac{(ax+b)(x+2)+c(x^2+3)}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \\
			&= \frac{ax^2+2ax+bx+2b+cx^2+3c}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \\
			&= \frac{(a+c)x^2+(2a+b)x+(2b+3c)}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \\
			&= \frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \\
			\therefore d = a+c, e = 2a+b, f &= 2b+3c \\
			b - c &= e - 2d \\
			b &= \frac{f + 3e - 6d}{5} \\
			c &= \frac{f - 3e + 6d}{5} \\
			a &= \frac{- 2f + 6e - 2d}{10} \\
		\end{align}
		Since $a, b, c$ can be expressed in terms of $d, e, f$, and $d, e, f$ can be
		expressed in terms of $a, b, c$, therefore the matrix describing the relationship
		between $a, b, c$ and $d, e, f$ is invertible. Therefore the partial fraction is 
		full rank, which is 3 because there are 3 variables. Therefore the partial fraction
		decomposition has a dimension of 3, which is consistent with the dimension of $V$.

\noin{\bf 1.}  Let $$V = \left \{ \frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \mid d, e, f\in \mathbb R\right \}$$  

\noin We define vector addition and scalar multiplication in $V$ by the usual function addition and scalar multiplication.  Then $V$ is vector space.

\vspace{20pt}

\noin{(b)}   Using that $\dim\, V=3$ from part (a), explain why we do not expect a partial fractions decomposition of the form
$$\frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)}  = \frac{a}{x^2+3}+\frac{b}{x-2}$$
to exist.

%Question 1(b)

	%%% Do not change the height of this box. Your work must fit inside it.
	
	\makenonemptybox{550pt}{

	%%% Your work goes here! 
	\begin{align}
		\frac{a}{x^2+3}+\frac{b}{x-2} &= \frac{a(x-2)+b(x^2+3)}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \\
		&= \frac{ax-2a+bx^2+3b}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \\
		&= \frac{bx^2+ax+(3b-2a)}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \\
		&= \frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} \\
		\therefore d &= b, e = a, f = 3b-2a \\
		\therefore f &= 3d - 2e \\
	\end{align}
	Since $f$ have to equal to $3d - 2e$, there exists partial fraction decomposition in the form 
	$\frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} = \frac{a}{x^2+3}+\frac{b}{x-2}$ if and only if $f = 3d - 2e$.
	Therefore the partial fraction decomposition in the form $\frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} = \frac{a}{x^2+3}+\frac{b}{x-2}$ 
	does not exist if $f \neq 3d - 2e$. Therefore $\frac{dx^2+ex+f}{(x^2+3)(x-2)} = \frac{a}{x^2+3}+\frac{b}{x-2}$ does not exist for all $f$.

\noin{\bf 2.}  Suppose that $W_1$ and $W_2$ are both three dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb R^4$.  In this question, we will show that $W_1 \cap W_2$ contains a plane. \\

\noin{(a)}  If  ${\bf u_1}, {\bf u}_2, {\bf u}_3$ all belong to $W_1$ explain why $W_1 \cap W_2$ contains a plane.
